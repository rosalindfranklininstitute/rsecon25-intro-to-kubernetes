# Introduction to Kubernetes Architecture

## Overview
Kubernetes is a powerful container orchestration platform that automates deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Its architecture is divided into two main parts:

- **Control Plane**
- **Worker Nodes**

---

## 🧭 Control Plane

The **Control Plane** is the brain of the Kubernetes cluster. It manages the cluster's state and makes decisions about scheduling, scaling, and responding to events.

### Key Components:
- **API Server (`kube-apiserver`)**:  
  Acts as the front-end for the Kubernetes control plane. All interactions (kubectl, dashboard, etc.) go through this RESTful API.

- **Controller Manager (`kube-controller-manager`)**:  
  Runs controllers that handle routine tasks like node health checks, replication, and endpoint management.

- **Scheduler (`kube-scheduler`)**:  
  Assigns newly created pods to nodes based on resource availability and constraints.

- **etcd**:  
  A distributed key-value store that holds all cluster data (state, configuration, etc.).

## 🧱 2. Worker Nodes

Worker nodes are where your application containers actually run. Each node has the following components:

### Key Components:
- **Kubelet**:  
  An agent that runs on each node. It communicates with the API server and ensures containers are running as expected.

- **Container Runtime**:  
  Software responsible for running containers (e.g., Docker, containerd).

- **Kube-proxy**:  
  Handles network routing and load balancing for services within the cluster.

## 🔄 3. How These Components Work Together

1. You submit a deployment via `kubectl`.
2. The **API Server** receives the request.
3. The **Scheduler** picks a suitable node.
4. The **Controller Manager** ensures the desired state is maintained.
5. The **Kubelet** on the chosen node pulls the container image and starts the pod.
6. **Kube-proxy** ensures networking is set up so the pod can communicate.

# 🧪 Minikube Architecture

Minikube is a local Kubernetes implementation that runs a single-node cluster inside a VM or container. It’s perfect for testing and development.

## How Minikube Maps to Standard Kubernetes:

| Standard Kubernetes | Minikube Equivalent |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| Control Plane       | Runs inside the Minikube VM/container |
| Worker Node         | Same VM/container acts as the worker node |
| Kubelet             | Runs inside Minikube |
| API Server          | Accessible via `kubectl` on your host |
| etcd, Scheduler, Controller Manager | All run inside the Minikube VM |

### Key Differences:
- **Single-node setup**: Control plane and worker node are co-located.
- **Simplified networking**: Easier to manage locally.
- **Ideal for testing**: Lightweight and fast to spin up.

## 🧰 Summary

- Kubernetes separates concerns between managing the cluster (control plane) and running workloads (worker nodes).
- Minikube mimics this architecture in a simplified, single-node environment.
- Understanding these components helps you debug, optimize, and scale your applications effectively.
